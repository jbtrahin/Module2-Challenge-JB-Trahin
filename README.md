Repository containing the spreadsheet and VBA scirpt that perform stocks analysis.

### Challenge 2 - VBA

#### Background
Steve is grateful for your help and loves the workbook you prepared for him. What he doesnâ€™t love, however, is the returns on the stocks in 2018. Steve wants to do a little more research for his parents, so he's gathering data for the entire stock market from the last few years. While the code we wrote works great for a dozen stocks, it might not work so well for thousands of stocks. (Remember, we had to loop through all of the stock data for each ticker we analyzed.)

To help Steve, refactor your code to loop through the data only once and collect all of the information it needs in a single pass. Refactoring is the process of reorganizing code without changing what it accomplishes. Code can be refactored to be faster, use less memory, or just to be easier to read.

#### What we did?
* We successfully refactored the code to make it flexible and applicable to any new sheet Steve will be creating.
* We generated a test sheet called "2009" to test our code and passed the test
* We provided a .vbs file withe code laid out with comments so Steve can easily copy paste in Excel.
* We made sure the buttons on Steve's spreadsheet worked.
